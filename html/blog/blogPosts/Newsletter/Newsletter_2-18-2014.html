<h3>The Happenings</h3>
<p>Today we had guest speakers from Microsoft, David Washington and Chris Koenig, talk about Windows Mobile App development. During our club meeting, David showed us how easy it was to create a simple app using <a href='http://apps.windowsstore.com/'>AppStudio</a>; an online app creation tool that grabs its content from RSS feeds, YouTube channels, or your own data files. Later in the evening, David and Chris ran a development workshop. There were a ton of great app ideas and A TON of people got their apps created and submitted to the Windows App Store. Now for the icing on top, anyone whose app gets accepted into the Windows Store gets a free Windows Phone! If you're still interested in developing an app for the free phone, feel free to contact me or David. </p>

<h4><i>Game Design Anyone?</i></h4>

<h4><i>3D Printing</i></h4>
<p>The 3D Printer has to be one of the coolest things I've used in a while. Being able to see a 3D model go from computer model to physical object is fascinating. Now you can try it out too. If you're interested in learning how to use the 3D printer, schedule a time with <a href='http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs.php?name=Chris'>Chris</a>. Unless you're granted special permission, you have to go through a short training with Chris before using the printer. Once you're using the printer, make sure you follow the <i>3D Printer Rules</i> found on the whiteboard behind the printer. If something you need to print requires breaking one of the rules, speak to Chris or an E-Board member first.</p>
<br>
<h4><i>Website Updates</i></h4>
<p>We recently added an "About Us" page - check it out <a href='http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs.php'>here</a>. I'd love to get feedback on the website. If you have any comments, ideas, or notice any bugs, let me know. Otherwise, our next steps with the website will be to create a real "Contact Us" page, fix a couple known bugs, and enhance the back-end features used by our writers.

<h4><i>Looking for a place to talk about your feelings?</i></h4>
<p>The Computer Science Club is looking for club members who are interested in contributing to our blog! You can write about any approved topic series, or submit a miscellaneous post now and then relating to Computer Science, Technology, Projects, etc. It'd be really cool if we could get a lot of activity on our website. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in doing now or later down the road.</p>
