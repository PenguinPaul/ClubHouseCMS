<h3>The Happenings</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone! Today we had Jennifer from the Career Center come in and talk about the job/internship opportunities available "just across Summit Ave." She talked about On Campus Interviews, different fairs run by the Career Center, and mentioned the large number of companies looking to hire Computer Scientists.  If you did not get any of the handouts, or did not make it to the meeting, contact me and I can forward you the information. </p>

<h4><i>UST Plays Pokemon</i></h4>
<p>
If you've been on the internet recently, you've most likely heard about <a href='http://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon'>Twitch Plays Pokemon</a>. For those who haven't heard, <i>Twitch Plays Pokemon</i> is a live stream of an emulator running <i>Pokemon Red</i>. What makes this stream unique, is that the viewers can actually cooperatively play the game through the group chat. Wouldn't it be cool if we had our own? Well Andrew Schleicher did just that. Thanks to Andrew, we will be showcasing <i>UST Plays Pokemon</i> this Friday at the LAN Party! We will be able to cooperatively play <i>Pokemon Fire Red</i> on the projector (granted that we can configure the server properly for the stream).  For those of you interested in how he created it, he will be writing a blog post about the process soon; so stay tuned!
</p>
<br>
<h4><i>Website Updates</i></h4>
<p>We recently added a <i>Social</i> Section. Inside the social section, members are allowed to write about any of the social events or any topic of their choice. If you get the chance, check out <a href="http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs?name=Spitzer">Spitzer's</a> first post in the social section. A great read with a lot of helpful life tips!<br>Soon we will be seeing blog posts about creating <i>UST Plays Pokemon</i>, and posts about Broderick Carlin's quest to print a 3D Printer.
</p>
<br>
<h4><i>Opportunities</i></h4>
<p>Rather than adding every single work opportunity to the newsletters like last semester, we're going to add a new section to the website. The <i>Opportunities</i> Section will hopefully be added this weekend. In this new section, you'll be able to find job/intern/volunteer opportunities sent to the club to be shared with all the club members. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Events to Come</h3>
<p> This Friday we will be having our LAN Party! We'll be playing a lot of games while enjoying free pizza sponsored by <a href='http://www.mavericksoftware.com/'>Maverick Software Consulting</a>. If you are free to help with set up or take down, please contact <a href='http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs.php?name=Alex'>Alex</a>.
