<p>
Sorry To disappoint everyone, but I did not release an app over Spring Break and I am still the Club President :)
For those of you who missed the meeting, as an April Fools Prank, I stepped down and convinced everyone that Spitzer was the new President of the Computer Science Club.

<h1>The Happenings</h1>
<p>
Today we had Dr. Yilek come in and give a presentation on the opportunities available by going to graduate school. It was a very informative talk on what it's like to get a PhD or Masters degree and what you would need to do to get ready for graduate school. If you're interested in learning more, I imagine Dr. Yilek would be more than okay talking about it during his office hours. 
</p>

<h2>LAN Party Committee Update</h2>
<p>
Today we had another LAN Party Committee meeting. I believe Spitzer will be talking more about this in a future blog post so I'll be brief. 
We reserved some rooms for the 11th of April, and are working out the details for some tournaments, prizes, and food. Stay tuned!
</p>

<h2>High School Volunteer Event</h2>
<p>
The executive board, led by Amanda, has been working on an Admissions event for High School students to come in and try out some of the technology we have and learn a little about programming in a few seminars. We're still working out the final details in the program, so once we have the event finalized, you will get an email about signing up! This will be a great (and easy) way to get your service hours for the week.
</p>

<h2>While We're on the Topic of Service Hours...</h2>
<p>
The service hours web form will be going live this weekend! You will be able to submit your volunteer hours straight on our website. Make sure you get your hours finished! You require 1.5 hours to remain in good standing.
