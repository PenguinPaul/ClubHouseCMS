<h2>The Happenings</h2>
<p>
Hey Everyone! Welcome back to another exciting newsletter.<br>
Today we had an encore visit from HighJump Software! Rachel and Reena led a great discussion on HighJump Software's business (warehouse management solutions) as well as the software development lifecycle, and some great job searching tips. To make a great speaking event even greater, HighJump Software catered some delicious Toppers Pizza and gave away free stress balls and chap stick! <br>
If you'd like to learn more about HighJump Software, feel free to contact Rachel!

<h3>LAN Party Success</h3>
As Spitzer mentioned in his latest blog post, the LAN Party was a big success. We had a turn out of 40+ students and were able to keep everyone entertained with Andrew's Twitch stream and the many computers hooked up to the LAN.<br><br>

With The end of the year coming up, we want our last LAN Party (or possibly two) to go out with a BANG. Seeing that the LAN Party is our biggest event and attracts students from outside the club, we've decided to create a LAN Party Committee. 
<br><br>
The LAN Party Committee is open to anyone interested in helping plan, organize, and market for the next LAN Party. This is a great leadership opportunity that you should definitely check out if you're considering running for the executive board this Spring. If you're interested in joining, feel free to contact <a href='http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs.php?name=Alex'>Alex</a> or <a href='http://www.csclub.stthomas.edu/aboutUs.php?name=Spitzer'>Spitzer</a>.

<h3>Club Room Rules</h3>
<p>
With the increasing popularity of the CS Club Room (OSS 429), we decided to write up some new rules. A draft of the rules were handed out today, and a revised version will be emailed out later this week. To retain your card access (or to get card access in the future) you must read through and sign the agreement. Breaking one of these rules may lead to the revocation of your card access. <br> If you have any concerns with the new policies, feel free to discuss them with Professor Jarvis, Amanda, or me.
