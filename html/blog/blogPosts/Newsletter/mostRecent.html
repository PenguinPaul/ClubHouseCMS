                <h1>The Happenings</h1>
<p>
Hey Everyone!<br>
Today we had our very own Chris Baldwin give his Independent Study presentation on Oculus Rift/Unity Development, and we had every say what their plans were for the summer. David Washington also give out two Nokia Lumia 1020's as well, so some students are going to have to create some crazy apps this summer!
</p>
<h2>Social Chair</h2>
<p>
We will be taking applications for a Social Chair for the upcoming year. The Social Chair is responsible for heading the Social Committee and thus getting social events planned. He or She will also be responsible for blogging a bit on the website and working with the executive board to plan budgets and such. This is not an elected posiotion, the executive board will conduct interviews and choose a candidate. If this is of any interest to you, shoot me an email and we'll set up an interview. 
</p>

<h2>Beta testing?</h2>
<p>
My Company is currently looking for Beta testers for our new app we're planning to release this summer. If you have an Iphone, and you would be interested in beta testing a really cool app, let me know and I'll send you the form.
</p>
<h2>Club Website Development</h2>
<p>
If you're interested in contributing to our website this summer, and did not get the chance to sign up at the club meeting today, let me knkow and I'll add you to the list. We'll get git set up and create a list of things we want to see improved with the website.
<br>Also If you're interested in blogging over the summer let me know, we can set that up as well.
