<h1>The Happenings</h1>
<p>
This week we had Symantec come in and discuss their line of work and a little bit about their history and different products they offer. Although Symantec is famously known for their product "<a href='http://us.norton.com/'>Norton Anti-Virus</a>", Symantec actually has other data protection tools that are used by a lot of big companies. They also took resumes at the last meeting, so hopefully some of us will be getting calls!

<h2>LAN Party Committee</h2>
<p>
As Spitzer mentioned in his last blog post, the LAN party committee met last Friday and it was a big success. For details on what we went over, feel free to look at Spitzer's post about it on the website.
</p>
<h2>Website Forms</h2>
<p>
there has been a lot of people wondering about the volunteer form and card access forms for the website. They will be added soon; most likely they will be added the week we get back from spring break. For those interested in developing for the website, that should be ready around the time the forms are done. 
</p>
<h2>Club Picture</h2>
<p>The other day we had our picture taken for the yearbook. Special Thanks to Theodore for taking the picture; we should have someone with mad Photoshop skills add him into our goofy picture (I would by my stick-man probably wouldn't look like him). The pictures will be added to our website today!
