                Hey Everyone!</p><p>Tuesday the Computer Science Club joined GPS for an introduction to Big Data with Dr. Rubin. We learned about all the ins and outs of Big Data and he even taught us the key to finding a job in the Big Data field (*hint* learn how to spell Hadoop). The coolest part had to be when Dr. Rubin showcased the power of Hadoop by sorting the words of over 4000 books in only a coupe of minutes! WOW! </p><p>The Computer Science Club has a newly updated website/blog! I just now updated the website to better reflect our club. Go check it out if you find the time. 
From now on, Job Opportunities and Projects will only be posted on the website, that way we can keep the emails strictly to what we've been doing and what events are coming up. It's pretty empty right now; I'll be adding content soon.</p><p>//Long post about the Website and the idea behind it
If you are interested in doing a blog series on the website, let me know. I wrote a small CMS that would allow anyone to make blog posts very simply; no HTML experience necessary ;)</p><p>If you'd rather, you can also write a single blog post and send it my way for approval. The point of the website is to showcase our skills and show how active we are in the tech community and our own community. So I think it'd be pretty cool to get some people writing!</p><p>Chris Baldwin will be doing a series on Tech development and research specifically around the Oculus Rift and the 3D Printer, definitely something you should keep your eyes out for!</p><p>The website is still new (I wrote it over the weekend), so if you find any bugs, or have some layout/design suggestions; let me know. I was able to make the website mobile friendly, so make sure you check it out on your phone as well. One of the new features coming soon will be an &quot;about us&quot; page, where people will be able to find our club constitution as well as pictures and bios of our E-board and bloggers. There will also be some back-end updates that will make it easier for bloggers to blog.</p><p>//small post about 3D printer and why I shouldn't use it
I know everyone's antsy to learn more about, and to start, using the 3D printer! We will be holding a how-to workshop SOON. We still have to finalize the date for that, but I'll let you know as soon as it's up on the Google calendar. DO NOT use the printer yet, we want to make sure anyone who is going to use it is trained in and ready. I should have waited myself before printing a new iPhone case... Needless to say I have a mess to clean up.</p><p>Events to Come:</p><p>This Thursday we will be having our &quot;Bowling with Jarvis&quot; event. Come join us in the student center at 7pm for free bowling and free food.
Feb 13, 2014</p><p>Next week we will be hosting David Washington from Microsoft. He's going to give a talk on Windows Mobile Development as well as give more information on the Workshop later that evening.
Feb. 18, 2014</p><p>The Evening of the 18th, David will be leading a workshop on mobile development.
