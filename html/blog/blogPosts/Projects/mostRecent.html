This post is part of a series following the independent study of Unity and Oculus Rift development by Chris Baldwin.

I chose <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> for very simple reasons. It is established in the app/game development world, it streamlines development, and the Oculus Rift came with 4 months of UnityPro membership. Extra perks to using Unity include native Javascript support, on-the-fly prototyping, and vast web tutorials. After watching a few videos explaining the Unity environment and basic concepts, I dove right in.

For my first project in Unity, I decided to follow a <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/26785-Unity-Jump-Start-Video-Tutorials">video tutorial for making a 2D proof of concept game</a>. I began last Monday (2/14/14), and completed the tutorial by Friday. It was amazing to see how quickly I had a functional product. I would recommend watching and following along with this tutorial for anyone that is interested in Unity development because it introduces essential concepts without assuming any prior knowledge. However, a basic understanding of Javascript is necessary.

One of the problems I ran into was the tutorial referencing legacy features of Unity, such as particle systems. In the tutorial, the guide is using an older version of Unity which used an older particle component that I was having troubles implementing. To get around this problem, I utilized the newer particle system component and spent time adjusting emission, shape, color over lifetime, and various other properties until everything seemed just right. 
</p>
<p class='baldwin'>
For example, when an enemy is destroyed, a red and orange particle effect is rendered and slowly dissipates. In order to have the particles fade out instead of suddenly disappear, I needed to adjust the alpha value in the color over lifetime property. I expect to run into similar problems in tutorials in the future where the current version of Unity offers slightly different components from the legacy ones.
