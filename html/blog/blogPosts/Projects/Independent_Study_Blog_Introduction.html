This post is part of a series following the independent study of Unity and Oculus Rift development by Chris Baldwin.

In 2012, <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/">Oculus VR</a> started selling development kits for their virtual reality head mounted display. Backed by testimonies from acclaimed video game developers like John Carmack, co-creator of DOOM, and Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve Corporation, the Oculus Rift promised to bring the best virtual reality experience into the hands of the consumer. After a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game">wildly successful Kickstarter campaign</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/12/oculus-vr-raises-75m-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-create-consumer-version-of-its-virtual-reality-goggles/">VC funding</a>, and <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a543250/ces-2014-oculus-rift-crystal-cove-hands-on-the-next-big-thing.html">numerous prototypes</a>, a consumer version of the Rift could be available as early as 2014.

Games are my personal hobby. I design, collect, test, hack, play, and discuss games everyday. From the moment I heard about the Oculus Rift, I was set on making a game based around this new technology. When I first put on the Rift, there was a moment of awe followed by sheer joy while exploring a virtual environment. I walked around a digital world that felt real for the first time. Just like when games went from 2D sprites to 3D models, I foresee another paradigm shift being caused by virtual reality. The Rift is not yet available to the consumers, thus now is the time to become adept at developing for this new platform.

We here at the UST computer science club have an Oculus Rift development kit, and I have been granted full access to it. This semester I am participating in an independent study focused on learning to use Unity, a powerful development engine with full Oculus Rift support, so that I can create a virtual experience for the Rift. It is exciting to be on the precipice of something new, and I canâ€™t wait to see where this goes.
