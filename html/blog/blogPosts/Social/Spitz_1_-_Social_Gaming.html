                <p>I know the title may seem like a paradox to those who believe in the predefined stereotype of hardcore gamers. That is, the archetype of the anti-social <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/Ocelot/megaultronnerd.jpg">out-of-shape guy</a> who plays video games for hours in his pitch-black basement while downing Mountain Dew, pizza, and n00bs in droves. However, I disapprove. For a closer look reveals that gamers are actually social creatures with intriguing personalities who relish bonding over a common technological medium. Well, at least the ones at our past LAN party!</p>

<p>Before I go any further I would like to thank all those who supported my first post! Honestly, I did not expect the reception I received. I didn't think anyone would read the thing, much less enjoy it! It makes me happy, because you were able to gain something from it.</p>

<p>This past LAN party was an awesome event! It allowed club members enjoy each other's company and unwind as the semester begins to ramp up. After sweating through the mess of setup, it was neat to see everyone excited and playing with friends in some cool virtual worlds. League of Legends was, as one would expect, the most popular title of the eve. Smash also had a very dedicated following. Other people were playing Civ 5 and a new title to the LAN; ORION: Dino Horde. The Oculus Rift demo session was also very popular, thanks to Chrisby. Even with all that, my LAN MVP goes to Andrew for creating our own version of "Twitch Plays Pokemon"; <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/ustplayspokemon">check it out</a>! I think he'll be talking more about the process soon.</p>

<p>Despite all the awesomeness, I know we can do much better. Here are a few of my ideas:</p>
	<h4>1. Setup</h4>
		We need to develop a schematic for our venue that compromises our resources and needs. Furthermore, we have to have this done promptly so that things are ready to go when the bell tolls. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
	<h4>2. Structure</h4>
		More structure is a good thing. We should certainly be able to organize tournaments for the popular games. Everyone playing their own LoL game is nowhere near as cool a huge tourny. I mean that's the point of a LAN party! We may need some admins for this.
	<h4>3. Promotion</h4>
	<p>We need to promote the event more. At the very least, get the word out among the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">STEM</a> community in OSS/OWS. Posters, FB, ASC banner, or whatever it takes. This will make the event as well as the club better. Another thing is Tommie Media. Dr. Jarvis brought this up to Ericson & I the other day. We're doing all this sweet stuff in our club and it's not getting any campus publicity. Does anyone have connections?</p>

<p>In closing, I'd like to sincerely thank our entire leadership, though namely Ericson & Marsh, for orchestrating this gathering. Events like this are awesome in and of themselves, but what's especially cool is that they build <strong>cohesion</strong>. This principle is very important to something like a school club or a team. The more comfortable we become with one another, the more things we'll accomplish. It's all about that synergy. Watch out UST, your CS club is gonna do some great things!</p>

<br/>TL;DR: The past LAN party was sweet, but still could be improved. Come to our meetings to have input on the next one.
