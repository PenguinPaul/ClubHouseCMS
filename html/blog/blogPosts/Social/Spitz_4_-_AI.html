                <p>And that's a wrap! Our last LAN party of the semester ended quite well despite a few bugs leading up to the event. I would like to extend my thanks to all those who came and supported the club, especially those who help set-up, take-down, & run the tourneys! It seems to be growing in popularity so it is important that we maintain a positive reputation outside the department. Special shout-out to <a href="http://personal.stthomas.edu/yile5901/">Dr. Yilek</a> who came and supported the club by participating in our SSBM tournament. I should mention that he did very well; 3rd out of 16! Thanks guys & practice up this summer!</p>

<p>An important aspect of nearly all video games, as you know, is artificial intelligence (AI). I personally find AI very intriguing, but as with most neat stuff it's not easy. That's something I've noticed over the years; anything that's cool is probably pretty complicated/difficult. Regardless if that theory is actually true or not, game AI has drastically improved over the years. It's been fun seeing this evolution first hand! However, game NPCs are only a subset of the overall broad CS research area of AI & machine learning. Now is a good time to put in a plug for the AI class the CS department will be offering next spring. It will be taught by the new hire; Dr. Lockwood. The class would serve as a nice formal intro to AI and will count towards elective credit.</p>

<p>I wanted to share a couple of documentaries with you concerning machine learning/AI. Both involve the technological innovating powerhouse IBM, which has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rochester">plant</a> in Rochester, MN. The first is "<a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/game-over-kasparov-and-the-machine/">Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine</a>". This came out in 2003 and focuses on the highly publicized chess matches between chess grandmaster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> and IBM supercomputer Deep Blue spanning 1996-1997. It's pretty dramatic as there was a lot of controversy surrounding the second match. What makes chess difficult is that each move of foresight introduces exponentially more moves to consider. I would certainly recommend viewing the documentary and would love to talk about it more in depth once you watch it. The second film is "<a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/smartest-machine-on-earth/">Smartest Machine on Earth</a>". Here the plot focus is another IBM supercomputer named Watson, which you may have already seen on NOVA. Watson plays a different (and much harder) game than its father Deep Blue; Watson plays Jeopardy! It's the ultimate test of one's breadth of knowledge. Jeopardy is difficult because of the verbose mind-bending language of the clues. While this may be the easy part for humans, it has been a struggle for computers until recently. To be fair Watson is not connected to the Internet, rather its preloaded with information that its creators deem useful. Again, you should view this documentary even if you are only remotely interested in AI. Both documentaries present amazing feats in the realm of artificial intelligence & machine learning despite doing so in different ways. As a little bonus, I'll throw in a TED talk by the legend himself, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_jennings_watson_jeopardy_and_me_the_obsolete_know_it_all">This</a> is to be watched only after you view "Smartest machine on Earth"; don't spoil it for yourself!</p>

<p>Of course all of this is for after finals. Another special shout-out to our awesome <a href="http://www.bradenericson.com/select.php?page=aboutMe">president</a> battling mononucleosis (mono). Get well soon; we're all behind you! Good luck to all of you as the semester draws to a close. I do have one more post in mind before Summer though...</p>

TL;DR: CS Club Spring 2014 was "off-the-chain" (as the kids say these days)! Several AI related links for your viewing pleasure.
