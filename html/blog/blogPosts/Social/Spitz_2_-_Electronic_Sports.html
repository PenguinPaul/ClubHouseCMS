                <p>Before we all hit the sunny beaches for SB, I'd like to share a few neat updates with you!</p>

<h4>1. CS Club LAN Party</h4>
First things first, the LAN Party committee had its initial meeting this past Friday. We covered a lot of ground, so I'll give you the highlights. Unfortunately, it's looking pretty unlikely that we'll be able to snag Woulfe Alumni Hall again. Yeah, that kind of bites. We checked 8 evenings (4 Fridays & 4 Saturdays) and it was booked solid, much to our surprise. We joked that we should start reserving it for the fall! With that, the location is still TBD. One thing we're going to do for sure is promote the next LAN more. It's gonna be trending across campus! We're adding in a competitive scene; as of now it appears that we'll be holding a 3v3 League of Legends bracket, 1v1 Super Smash bracket, and a massive Civ 5 game. Tell your friends & help spread the word! Also, if you have some items that may help us out (e.g. switches, power strips, etc.) keep them handy. We found out Jake has 2 16-port switches in his dorm room; let's hope they work (*crosses fingers*)!

<h4>2. "<a href="http://www.freetoplaythemovie.com/">Free to Play</a>"</h4>
Another thing I wanted to mention is that Valve's internally produced documentary "Free to Play" launches on March 19th. For the non-gamers, Valve is a game development company that also owns and manages a digital distribution platform called Steam. If you're on Steam you probably heard of this documentary, and if you play Dota 2 you've def heard about it. Now I know we don't have too many Dota fans in the club (aside from me & <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/bDFury">the best Dota 2 player @ UST</a>), but I would argue it's more about the competitive gaming overtones. League players please give it a chance; Valve is a pretty awesome company and I'm sure this documentary will be very high quality as is nearly everything that they make. The main storyline focuses on 3 of the best gamers in the world (who come from very different backgrounds) on their quest to win one of the largest gaming tournaments in the world! That sounds pretty epic. We were thinking about a launch-day viewing party but knew midterms are more important then games even for the CS Club! Though we still may show it on a projector at the next LAN Party.

Finally, I stumbled on this article/podcast via NPR's "all tech considered" (a pun on their "all things considered"). It's gives a great overview of E-sports to those who are unfamiliar with the competitive scene. I think E-sports will only grow in the years to come with recent technological advances (such as mass live streaming). While I wouldn't count on NPR for ground-breaking game updates, they're a very well respected news outlet generally speaking. Furthermore, they have a lot of other cool things you may like in their "all tech considered" section. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/">Check it out</a>; I'll probably cite it again in the future.

<p>Well I hope that satisfied your cravings. If you're on Steam join <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/UST-CS">our group</a>. As always, thanks for your support. Good luck on those midterms & have an awesome spring break!!</p>
