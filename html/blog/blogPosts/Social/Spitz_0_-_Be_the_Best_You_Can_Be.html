                <p>Welcome to my blog everyone! Since this is my inaugural post I thought I'd discuss a broad topic but one that's close to heart. This reason being is that you always remember your first. Your first program, first video game, or first kiss. Thus, I wanted this issue to be extra special. It'll be an ease into blogging; giving me and you an awesome post to remember! So, let's run over the syllabus--I'll go over the IDEA learning objectives--and then we'll jump right into chapter 1. JK all the way; I'm sure you've heard a version of that line enough! What I actually want to talk about is what it means to be the best you can be.</p>

<p>When I was a young little Spitzer (with less hair btw) my Dad brought home a book for me one night. It was a children's book written by the Twins HoF baseball player Kirby Puckett, titled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Be-Best-You-Can/dp/0931674204">Be the Best You can be</a>". This was a big deal to me because it was so unexpected. My Mom was always the one who tried to shove books down my throat (I appreciate it now looking back), my Dad was certainly not like that. Roughly a decade later, I sit at my desk writing a blog post for the CS club and still have the book. Don't worry this is not a spoiler alert; I'm not going to discuss the contents of the book and ruin it for you! Although, I would like to point out a few of my own beliefs on the topic. Here they are (not in any particular order):<p>

<h4>1. Attitude is a small thing that makes a big difference.</h4>
Yes it is. Any time I get hit with negative blow in my life I always spin it around and use it to my advantage. I fail test; I recognize my mistakes & start preparing for the next. I get pwned in a game; I'm on the web reading strats & adjusting my play-style. I get rejected by a girl; I stay positive, man-up, and approach the next one. If you stay positive and quit being a "Nagative Nancy" you will achieve much more in life because you'll find more enjoyment in the things you do.
<h4>2. Help others, particularly those who are less fortunate than you.</h4>
	This is at the heart of my moral fiber. It was instilled there at a young age by my Father. Don't leave this for the next person, do it yourself. Make time.
<h4>3. Realize you can only control your own life (it's not an RTS).</h4>
	You have to recognize that the world is not always fair; bad things happen to good people and good things happen to bad people. Don't let your emotions get the best of you, channel them into something that will benefit those around you. Focus on what you can control (your life) and make the most of it.
<h4>4. Success is <strong>NOT</strong> individual.</h4>
	My Dad told me to "never forget those who helped you get to where you are today". Maybe he was saying this for his own good, since himself and my Mom are the ones who I owe the most for my success! Nevertheless, I've held true to this and now it is one of my core beliefs. We have a sweet club that's apart of a great department which is housed in an amazing school located in a wonderful metro area... you see where I'm going!?!?! We need to help each other do awesome things!!! The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts; it's all about that synergy.
<h4>5. Have confidence, it's an important virtue (of course don't be overconfident).</h4>
	Confidence will help in everything; interviews, presentations, and just talking to people in general. People with confidence are slow and articulate with their speech, they don't talk fast. They hold eye contact like <a href="http://personal.stthomas.edu/sawi0750/">Dr. Sawin</a>! They never settle for mediocrity. You can't believe in anything until you first believe in yourself.
<h4>6. Be Prepared</h4>
	It's the Boy Scout motto (I'm sure the Girl Scouts too would agree this is important). Preparation makes things easier. It brings a piece of mind, which in and of itself helps performance. I prepare for everything. From the very simple things--like picking out my clothes the night before--to the very difficult things--like final exams--I make sure I'm always as ready as possible for whatever obstacles each day presents.
<h4>7. Be nice & respect the opinions of others.</h4>
	Treat <strong>EVERYONE</strong> with the utmost respect and kindness. It's much much easier to get along with people this way. Be polite not rude; use those manners like a boss!
<h4>8. You're attempt may fail, never fail to make an attempt.</h4>
	This goes along with the phrase "fortune favors the bold". Always, "Just Do It" and "Go for the Gold". Okay, enough quotes. Opportunities don't fall in your lap, but they're ofter within reach. A friend of mine recently applied to several top tech companies for a summer internship, these included Google, Facebook, and Twitter among others. He was telling me that he probably won't land any of them due their ultra-competitive nature. Although, he's gonna be (much more than) alright because he's not afraid to fail. Never be afraid of failure. People will tell you I like to participate in class. What they probably won't tell you is that I'm wrong a fair portion of time. I participate though because I want to make the most of my time.
<h4>9. "Ask me; I'm here to help!"</h4>
	<p>Maximize the use of your resources. Improve your <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=google-fu">google-fu</a>, go to tutor hours, talk to your professor when they're in their office. There's a great support network for you at St. Thomas, but it's your job to initiate. The only thing worse then struggling with something is struggling with something alone (well, besides wet socks).</p>

<p>Now it's your turn! People don't usually make a list of 9 things; pick something you think is important to becoming the best you can be so there are 10 things. I trust your judgment. If you take these nine principles (and the one you add) and begin to apply them to your daily life, you'll be well on your way to becoming the best you can be! Do it; your future self will thank you. Our club and everyone in it is destined for great things. Make dreams come true...</p>
