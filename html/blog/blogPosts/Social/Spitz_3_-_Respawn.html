                <p>Wow! Looking at the "Social" thread post history, you'd think I went on to a warm beach for sb and never came back! Well those of you who know the mind behind this madness know that was certainly not the case. I first offer my apologies to those who always anxious anticipate my blogs. Well... actually that probably isn't anyone. Seriously though, to the CS club and especially those who have supported me this semester I'm sorry for going afk for over a month.</p>

<p><i>"So Spitzer, what have you been doing this whole time?"</i></p>

<p>You ask a good question mate. I've been all over the place, literally. Milwaukee (my hometown) for sb to visit with the fam, Albuquerque the weekend after that for an AMS meeting with fellow club members Chrisby & Nicole, Rochester for Easter break. Actually btw, Rochester is a hint to my next post. If you know anything about the city, you should contextually be able to figure out what I'm referencing. Additionally--for those who live under a rock--we had a big LAN party since my last post. I was so focused on trying to make that an awesome experience that I put the blog way down on the priority list. That's kind of where it stayed. Soon I began to be <a href="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/322/7/f/spiderman__venom_by_jorel88-d334sh1.jpg">consumed by the parasite</a> of depression. <a href="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/220/6/4/spiderman_vs_venom_by_retrogorgon-d5abiso.jpg">Bogged down and slowed</a> by its 'venomous gale', I wasn't sure if I would ever be my own master again. Okay that's a bit (or maybe a byte) of exaggeration, but I couldn't pass up the dramatic opportunity and the chance to make <a href="http://personal.stthomas.edu/yile5901/">Dr. Yilek</a> (aka Peter Parker)--an occasional reader--happy with some Spidey imagery. FYI, he's a beast at super smash, so you better practice up before our next LAN party which will be happening soon. Last time was a blast, but as always we don't stop at 'blast' we go for 'super-ultimate-blast holographic first-edition' quality LAN parties. Things will be progressing quickly; start warming up!</p>

<p>I wanted to tell you that I dusted off my keyboard because of how many awesome people we have in the club! On the eve of elections, I had several members openly encourage me to run for an E-board position. While I'm sincerely humbled by and grateful for such feelings, I definitely did not want a spot on the E-board. I'll be a super-senior next year and thus have already made my mark on the club over the years. It's time for the younger generation to take the lead and have their chance in the limelight. They certainly deserve it! However, I will mention that it was because of those members who thought I should run that I'm back here behind your monitor again. For a club that has provided me with so many great opportunities, memories, and most importantly relationships it is the least I can do to give back. "And so, my fellow CS club members: ask not what your club can do for you, ask what you can do for your club." -JFK (adapted by JMS)</p>
