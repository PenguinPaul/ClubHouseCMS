ClubHouseCMS
============

Hello,

Hope everyone's been enjoying their summer so far. Let's cut right to the chase.

The website's source code can be found here: https://github.com/bradenericson/ClubHouseCMS

Here are some awesome git tutorials/resources courtesy of Paul:
-	Easy to use Windows GUI:  	https://windows.github.com/
-	GIT command line tutorial: 	https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
-	Simple GIT Guide:		http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
-	latest version of GIT:		http://git-scm.com/downloads

We had a large checklist of things to continue on with the website, but I seem to have misplaced it. I'll find it and create a Google spreadsheet by the end of the week. You guys will be able to add to the do list and mark which item on the list they want to work on (that way we don't have two people doing the same thing).

The cool thing about this project is, in the end, we want to make it a simple Content Management System designed for clubs. The end goal will be to create something that a club could download, install, and have a customized website ready to go. 

"Why would we want to make an easy to use club CMS? Why not just build our webpage and leave it at that?"

That's a great question! One reason is resume building. A lot of people can say they have built a website, but how many people can say they've created a full blown CMS? Not to mention a CMS that's dedicated to school clubs? (psst it doesn't exist yet!). Experience with Git, opensource, and the technologies we're using will help you greatly in your future internship/career searches as well. When I interviewed at Symantec, they said it helped greatly that I already knew GIT and AngularJS.

Technologies involved as of right now:
Bootstrap:	 http://getbootstrap.com/
jquery:	 http://jquery.com/
PHP:		 http://www.php.net/manual/en/ 
AngularJS: https://angularjs.org/ (used for creating blog posts atm)
GIT:		see above links

And I think that's it... There are some great tutorials out there on these topics, if you need a recommendation for any of the topics let me know.

We'll eventually be hooking up a database, creating a login system so all club members can log in (and some with have special admin privileges to delete or write posts)

Jake also suggested the ideas of a form for club members to talk and share things. That'll be added, we'll have to look at some ideas for that. 

For right now, try getting GIT to work and download the repository. Look through the code and try to understand it. Feel free to fix some of my silly bugs (a lot of the code is pretty raw and not commented. Feel free to fix things and push them back to the master).

If you have any questions about any of this, just let me know.
